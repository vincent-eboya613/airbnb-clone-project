UI/UX Design Planning for Our Booking System
My main goal for this design is simple: I want to make booking incredibly easy, intuitive, and efficient for everyone. It's all about making users happy, so they complete their bookings quickly and feel good about coming back.

Key Features We Need:
We've got to have robust search and filtering so people can find exactly what they're looking for. Then, we need a clear way to display listings and a super detailed view for each property, with great pictures and all the info. Integrating an interactive map is a must, and we definitely need user accounts for managing bookings and preferences. A secure payment system, reviews, and a wishlist are also critical. And of course, the whole thing needs to be responsive so it works on any device!
